				</h2>
				<p class="serviceCard__text text-xl py-4">Diyora has developed a cutting-edge machine that employs advanced imaging technology to generate a high-resolution 3D image of a diamond, including any impurities or fractures present within the sample. The machine is designed to analyse a single diamond sample and generate a detailed 3D image of the diamond on a computer.
				  <br/>
				  <br/>
				</p>
				<p class="serviceCard__text text-xl py-4">This innovative technology provides a non-destructive means of analysing the diamond sample and can be used to virtually cut the diamond to identify the number of diamonds that can be made.

				  </h2>
				  <p class="serviceCard__text text-xl">Diyora recognized a challenge faced by small, local jewellery retailers in India, where customers hesitated to purchase from these retailers due to a perceived lack of design options and uncertainty about product quality.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				  </p>
				  <p class="serviceCard__text text-xl">Diyora envisioned becoming the mediator between these small local jewellery shops and customers. They wanted to build a platform where customers visit these small jewellery shops and have kiosks placed by Diyora to help them browse through an excellent top-notch array of designer jewellery. The jewellery should also be authenticated to assure customers of its quality, which helps generate more footfall for local retailers.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				  </p>
				  <p class="serviceCard__text text-xl">The ultimate aim of the platform is to empower local jewellery shop owners, enabling them to increase their sales and move beyond being mere repairers. A major challenge in developing this platform was the volatility of gold jewellery prices, which fluctuate significantly, resulting in difficulty in obtaining real-time values along with diamond price calculations as every design is fully customised.

			  </h2>
			  <div class="row">
				<div class="col-md-6 mb-48">
				  <p class="serviceCard__text text-xl">We developed a kiosk management system to facilitate the management of kiosks installed in associated retailers&#039; outlets. This system enables customers to browse through thousands of listed jewellery designs seamlessly.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				  </p>
				  <p class="serviceCard__text text-xl">The system&#039;s primary challenge was the complexity of pricing diamonds based on three critical variables: size, shape, and quality. We leveraged technology to develop a 3D matrix structure that automates the calculation of diamond prices.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				  </p>
				  <p class="serviceCard__text text-xl">The kiosk browsing process is user-friendly, and as the customer selects a particular design, the system generates the real-time value of the selected product. Once an order is placed, it is transferred to the associated retailer, who forwards it to Diyora manufacturers.Â These manufacturers are responsible for producing and delivering the design to the retailer to fulfill the customer&#039;s order.

				  <p id="ivgmn" class="serviceCard__text text-xl">The Diyora platform includes an admin panel for managing product inventory. The panel allows for creating multiple product entries, which can be assigned categories and subcategories, as well as multiple variants. These variants include different types of metals, such as gold, rose gold, white gold, yellow gold, and varying carat weights. Additionally, multiple diamond qualities such as shape, carat, purity, and size can be assigned to each product.
					<br/>
					<br/>
				  </p>
				  <p class="serviceCard__text text-xl">Once inventory is uploaded to the admin panel, multiple retailers can be created and assigned specific sets of products from the product database. These retailers can then create and manage their own kiosks, where they can customise which products to display and manage their own discount systems. Retailers can also fully customise their kiosks by adding their logos and banners.

					<b id="ijub1o-2-7" class="serviceCard__text text-xl">User Experience Design
					</b>
					<br/>
					<br/>Our team conducted a thorough analysis of user psychology to understand the design elements that would make the kiosk user-friendly and intuitive. We evaluated the key information that retailers and customers need to access and map out the entire user journey from start to finish. Our UX design process considered various factors, including how users would interact with the kiosk and what information should be displayed first.

					<b>User Interface Design
					</b>
					<br/>
					<br/>We designed the user interfaces for both the retailer dashboard and the kiosk, focusing on creating an intuitive and seamless experience for the users. Our team identified potential user challenges and worked to solve them creatively. Our design process involved sketching concepts on paper and creating a grey-scale version before refining the final visual design. The design team employed a 3D effect on the kiosk interface to create a lifelike experience for the customers, unlike just listing products on an ecommerce platform. This design approach was adopted to enhance the visual appeal of the kiosk and create an immersive experience for the users.

					<b id="iq8i1a-2-7">Development
					</b>
					<br/>
					<br/>The development of the kiosk management system started with breaking down existing problems and with the creation of Database schema and development of APIs, followed by several rounds of testing,  which served as the foundation for the platform. We then built the kiosk app and the single-page application (SPA) dashboard for retailers and administrators. The dashboard includes features for settings management, order management, product management, kiosk management, and retailer management, providing Diyora with the ability to manage and customise its catalogues and designs.
					<br/>
					<br/>The system&#039;s algorithms were designed to accurately calculate the real-time value of diamonds based on size, shape, and quality, which are the key variables determining the price of diamonds using a 3d matrix.
					<br/>
					<br/>We also used the recursive waterfall engineering model and agile methodology to cover the changes request. By this, we ensured to reach the optimal functional requirement of the applicationÂ
